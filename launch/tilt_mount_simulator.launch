    <!-- This launch file provides a simulated industrial robot

        Several nodes are started, to simulate low-level robot communication
        and higher-level actionlib support:
            - industrial_robot simulator : accepts motion commands and publishes robot state

        Usage:
            hdt_simulator.launch
